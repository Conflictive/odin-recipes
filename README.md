# Odin Recipes

My first project for **The Odin Project** foundations curriculum. A simple, static recipe website built using only raw HTML.

**[View Live Demo](https://conflictive.github.io/odin-recipes/)**

## Skills Demonstrated
* **HTML5 Structure:** Correct use of semantic tags, boilerplate, and block vs. inline elements.
* **File Management:** Organized directory structure for pages and assets.
* **Navigation:** Linking pages using relative paths.
* **Content Formatting:** Using ordered/unordered lists and embedding images.

> **Note:** This project intentionally contains **no CSS/Styling** to focus purely on HTML structure.
